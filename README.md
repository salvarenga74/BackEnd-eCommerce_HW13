## Description

In this application I created a Node.js command-line application that can be used to create a HTML website that displays the basic information of every employee that was entered by the user. The application was built without significant starter code and assumes that the first team member of the work team will be a manager. From there the user will be prompted until all the members of the team has been added.

This application also includes testing parameters for each employee and will ensure proper information is being inputted into the respective fields.

See Deployed Application: [Note Taker Dashboard](https://gentle-sea-38975.herokuapp.com/)
